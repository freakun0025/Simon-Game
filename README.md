# Simon Game

This is a simple Simon Game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game presents a series of colors that the player has to repeat in the correct order. Each round adds a new color to the sequence, making the game progressively more challenging.
To play the game you can go to [Simon-Game](https://simon-game0025.netlify.app/)

## How to Play

1. Press any key to start the game.
2. Watch the sequence of colors presented by the game.
3. Repeat the sequence by clicking on the colored buttons in the correct order.
4. The game adds a new color to the sequence each round.
5. If you repeat the sequence correctly, you advance to the next level. Otherwise, the game ends, and you can start over by pressing any key.

## Project Structure


- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure of the game.
- `styles.css`: The CSS file for styling the game.
- `index.js`: The JavaScript file containing the game logic.
- `sounds`: A directory containing the sound files for the game.

## JavaScript Code Explanation
A library called jQuery has been used so as to have compact code writing

### Variables

- `gamePattern`: An array to store the sequence of colors generated by the game.
- `userClickedPattern`: An array to store the sequence of colors clicked by the user.
- `buttonColours`: An array containing the possible colors in the game.
- `started`: A boolean to check if the game has started.
- `level`: A variable to keep track of the current level.

### Functions

- `nextSequence()`: Generates the next color in the sequence, updates the game pattern, plays the corresponding sound, and animates the button.
- `playSound(name)`: Plays the sound associated with the given color.
- `animatePress(currentColour)`: Animates the button press by adding and removing a CSS class.
- `checkAnswer(currentLevel)`: Checks if the user's input matches the game pattern. If the input is correct and complete, it advances to the next level. Otherwise, it ends the game.
- `startOver()`: Resets the game variables to start over.

### Event Handlers

- `$(document).keypress(function() { ... })`: Starts the game when any key is pressed.
- `$(".btn").click(function() { ... })`: Handles button clicks, records user input, and checks the user's answer.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository or download the ZIP file.
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser to play the game.
